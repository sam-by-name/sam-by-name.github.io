        <h2>Snippet Sized Sam</h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome, my birth name is Sam but you can call me whatever you feel best suits me :) 
          This website is my first online creation and I hope it at least provides you with something...
          The primary purpose of this site is to learn, grow, practice and to catalog my progress as I
          carve my path through the illuminated pixels, with these electrified keys that build and shape our web of 
          ideas, facts and fantasies.
          But why learn a written only language some may ask? In a world of infinite possibilities. 
          Why that, when you can dismantle, build, and restore homes, furniture, vehicles, computers, 
          phones. Why head towards a life so seemingly different, so ... lacking substance.
          Why put your mind and skills towards dismantling, building, restoring and creating something, 
          virtually unreal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I am glad you asked and in truth my answers are many... 
          But today I'll give just one. 
          We have progressed so far and now we are at a time and place in our species development. Where 
          we must build and grow the unseen to better nurture and structure our continued growth.
          We Humans emerged from the wild, tools in hand, and soon learnt the strength of collaboration
          and numbers to fight our way to the top. But we have (I believe anyway) come to a
          point, where we need to dig down deeper, into the ourselves individually and self progress en-mass.
          Rather than just being 7+ billion specialists we need to diversify internally.<br><br>
          "Errr ... Sam, I believe you were supposed to be telling us the "Why" to the Web n stuff"
          Alright, alright hold your horses, I'm getting there :p<br><br>
          Basically 7+ billion people is more than a few I reckon and with so many clusters of people ranging from 
          small to moderate, all competing and working towards their own goals. Its no small surprise that we oft
          trample ourselves/nature/ourselves and our own progression.
          Enter the "Web"!!! 
          Through it we can connect seamlessly to anywhere, anytime we feel like it ... "thats a cool fad" 
          some may say. But in my eye's it can be one of two things, just another nail in our coffin, or
          that missing link we have been needing and searching for. That glue to link and bind us together 
          and not just us actually, but also all of our wonderful and whacky inventions.
          But it doesn't just build, maintain and guide itself, no, thats where you and me come in.
          And that is my first reason, you will have to grab a coffee with me to find out my many more :D 
        </p>
<!--          And now a little bit of background.
          Born son of 
            Paul Sanders: a wonderful writer, composer, teacher and musician. 
            Denise Nixon(Black): an auspicious actor, singer and all-out performer. 
          Into a crazy loving home of creative energy, forever submersed in and surrounded by the arts.

        

        Born into a universe of possibilities new and old. 
        Take your pick, play it safe or play it bold.
        Into a world of people fueled by interest and desire, 
        by liquid flames of emotion that inspire.<br><br>
        A well progressed state of man,
        But speeding so fast now, without a plan, 
        Do we jump on the wheel and dance to the same beat,
        Or waltz in a new direction with a higher chance of defeat?
        
        
        Placed directly in the middle of nowhere, yet exactly where i needed to be, to be me. -->
