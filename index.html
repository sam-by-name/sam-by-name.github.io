      <div>
        <p>Theoretically tumbling through troubled times,<br>
        My minds mentality, mortally mashed,<br>
        Righteous reality rapidly ravaged,<br>
        Whilst wishful, wonderment, wrongly warped.<br>
        Loving, longevity, loathingly lost,</p>
            
        <p>The mind of a lost man,<br>
        Cradled by all that care,<br>
        Lost through choice,<br>
        Or that of despair?</p>
        
        <p>An angel appears, announcing accountability and avoids<br>
        Certain criticisms, causing Christianity’s certain crumble.<br>
        Supreme symbols suddenly shattered, so<br>
        Mankind must malevolently manage morality<br>
        Individually. Initially I implicate irrevocability instantly.</p>
        
        <p>Now aware of no other higher being,<br>
        He finds his feet,<br>
        And when he looks, he is truly seeing,<br>
        He swears never again to admit defeat.</p>
        
        <p>Forever forgetting fundamental flaws,<br>
        Beings benefit blundering brutalities,<br>
        Divided difference’s dispels derogatory divulgement,<br>
        Personal preservation promises psychological paving,<br>
        Ever evolving essential empathy.</p>
        
        <p>Again confused, he reaches for his gun,<br>
        Looks into the mirror,<br>
        But all he sees is his own son.<br>
        Suddenly aware of his prior decision,<br>
        He renters life, back to remission.</p>
