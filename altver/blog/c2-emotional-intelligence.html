          Q.<br> What learning's did you take from the chapter and how did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.<br> After reading the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself and after watching a few youtube videos of Chade-Meng Tan. The Jolly good fellow is indeed a fitting title.<br>
          I love hearing of someone from such a renowned place and position, being allowed the time to develop such a course and also being given the time and space to teach and give it to those around him.<br>
          Age does not limit nor define ones ability to grow and change.<br> Growth internally is not just good for the individual, but also for the whole.<br> 
          The minds wellbeing is deeply entwined with the body, a symbiotic relationship of inter-connectedness and dependence. His words and the messages that he convay's, chime with me and my view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mindfulness, a practice that brings me great joy and strength. I love to succeed for others it brings me unfathomable peace and stored resilience.<br>
          A victory for all, because not only are our minds and bodies wellbeing connected, but so too are we to those around us and in turn they to us.
          As far as I have ever been able to see, all religions, faiths, traditions or other, share at least one belief in common ..<br>
          Love is great!<br>
          So my belief is to hone that skill first and deal with the rest afterwards.
