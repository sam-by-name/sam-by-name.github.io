        <h2>Reflect on Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I got blocked on a part of the "Dom Events and Classes" assignment,             
          After a couple attempts at making it right,<br>
          I started to look over the code to see where it was breaking, 
          I tried rolling back to where it was working before,
          but no joy in finding what and where so I decided to take a break.
        </p>
          <ul class="context">
            <li>I put "Macaroni Union"'s Weightless on.</li>
            <li>I sat on the floor.</li>
            <li>Closed my eyes and began breathing slowly and thoughtfully.</li>
            <li>After a while I started to visualize what I had just been typing.</li>
            <li> Why I had been typing and the control flow of the script.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          When I got back up and re-read the assignment and the code I was writing, I instantly
          saw that I had misread and been putting the latest code into the wrong function.
          A quick copy and paste and off I went.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been using a bit of psudocode here and there but feel like it is going to become more 
          and more relevant as I start to write scripts from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not used the Rubber ducky method as yet, but I do talk though the problem with myself,
          i.e. voice my process, what tools I have used and what has/hasn't worked and this 
          often works well for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done used Dev tools to locate where I am going wrong more than a few times, sometimes with success
          sometimes not.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not used much console logging as yet, but instead used Dev tools to find where the break point is.<br>
          If I cannot see the answer after using some of my tricks and methods Goggle gets a barrage of 
          clicks and questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not been asking my peers as yet for help as yet. This is mainly due to my need to know I have 
          thoroughly tried all my techniques and have given it my best shot before asking. But also due to wanting
          for those I ask to be at a similar point and as such be going through the same work as me (or have already done),
          which is why I have slowed my progress through through EDA's source content and over the next 1-2 weeks will
          be re-enforcing what I have already learnt and going through some additional material. So I can the progress 
          in a more collaborative manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find that reflection is forever imperative in growing and learning from our life lessons
          and experiences.
