          <strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that as I got to grips with Skeletons with its ins and outs. My seemingly simple design 
          was not so simple within the confines of this bare bones framework.
          So in came the "process over product" mantra and after a little on the spot redesigning of my redesign, 
          I had a semi-decent, functional and responsive template.

          <strong>Your previous view on meditation, new aspects you have gleaned or that stood out?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>    
          This chapter focused heavily on the different ways one can meditate, 
          from the old and traditional, to the new and subtle ways that we can take 
          a moment to reflect and reconnect with ourselves. A lot of the western world's early 
          years of teaching, revolve around getting us ready for society and 
          how to interact within it with others. While this is in no way a bad thing to teach, 
          sadly something quintessential to our journey through life is missed in these 
          first steps and many go a long way without learning how to be with just themselves,
          how to know themselves, to understand who we the individual are and how to 
          be ones own friend.<br>Meditation and its many ways of practicing it, is the 
          nurturing of the self that we all need to live our lives to their full.
          It's nice to see it shown in so many simple ways, so as to dispel the overly 
          spiritual and or religious shroud that surrounds it in so many's minds.<br>
          The main new whispers of wisdom that I walked away with this time are,
          that as I had previously thought, the mind is very much a muscle and that through 
          the focusing of attention and un-focusing, intentional or otherwise it grows in strength
          and response time.

          <strong>Any other musings?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, it was nice to here about the studies regarding the effects of taped 
          meditation instructions (received audio waves / music) being given to some of the test 
          participants and how it had been recorded to show hastened healing. Long have I 
          used music and sounds for a host of different circumstances, ranging from getting up and out 
          quick like, calming, a metronome for those days that feel like a slog, syking up for 
          the gym. It's interesting to hear of scientific proof and the releasing of it in to the wild.
