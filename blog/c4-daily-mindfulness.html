          <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I started a formal conversation with my cousin. While it started off formal and somewhat 
          awkward to begin with (rules to a conversation seem a bit unnatural) it became informal,
          informative and went on for a decent amount of time.<br>The parentheses to our mindful 
          conversation were adhered to ... but not actually because they were stated beforehand.<br>
          I find that generally people are actually pretty good at being mindful of others in conversations
          and that it is only in more heated debates or the likes that courtesy of others can go out 
          the window somewhat.<br>It was a positive conversation for both.
        </p>

          <strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Do less than you can, is definitely one to remember, because, while we are all 
          capable of doing more than our current output, sometimes to keep things fresh and ourselves
          at our maximum. Multiple small portions are more manageable and enjoyable than one large one.
        </p>      
        <p>
          <strong>Any other musings?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          What Chade-Meng Tan is predominantly talking about in this chapter is "Mindfulness", unfortunately ...
          he was not overly mindful of his readers and so it contains a large amount of filler, less pertinent 
          to his themed message.<br>
          Meditation and Mindfulness can be used and exercised in multiple ways within 
          and throughout our day.<br> But rather than regurgitate in brief what he dances in and around, 
          I shall instead give a short variation, in the hope of reinforcing something we already knew.<br>
          Living beings of all shapes and forms, are all exquisitely unique individuals. Venturing their way through
          this infinitely massive, gloriously weird and wonderful Universe (whatever that infant is).<br>
          We all love feeling good, receiving positive feedback, reaching common ground and being regularly 
          reminded how small the world really is. We all get a little lost or confused along the way,
          sometimes even a little scared and alone. It's so easy to feel insignificant in the ruckus of the 
          masses.<br> 
          Who am I? What am I? Why am I? How can I show and share that which makes me special? And of course 
          what on Earth is that anyway?<br>
          Mindfulness is a word used to describe that which joins us all, the constant reminder of our 
          inter-connectedness and through its practice we survive, strive, and thrive together.<br>
          Meditation is a word used to embody the act of reflection, not just of the self, but also of the 
          fractalized whole. Through its practice we refresh, reconnect and rekindle our united goal.<br>
          These two acts of being occur naturally, but can be practiced to enhance life for all involved.   
          One simple little trick to oft deploy, is to take a step back and remember
          Life is awesome and you are life, so ...
