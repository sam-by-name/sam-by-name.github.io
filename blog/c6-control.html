          <strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          When programing, one of my triggers would be when I feel like I am not progressing as fast as I know 
          I can. This can cause frustration which certainly does not help me go any faster. Fortunately I am 
          aware of it and catch it early on. I deal with it via a few different methods, 
          <ul>
            <li>Some fresh air</li>
            <li>Rapid meditation</li>
            <li>Push ups</li> 
          </ul>
          Another trigger and one that I believe gets many of us, is when I finally find the solution to something 
          I have been racking my brain on for a while ... and find that it was actually just some silly oversight.
          Thats a little quirk I'v had for a long time so I actually just smile when it happens now :)

          <strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>          
          The SBNRR exercise is something I have been practising (though I didn't know it's name had been coined) 
          for quite some time. You see, I was what a fair few teachers called "naughty", I had too many questions
          and I responded to quickly. <br>So between being told to "Think before you speak" more times than I care to count
          (when I was a kid this is) and having an undiagnosed stomach ailment that caused me to be unable to 
          keep food down for up to a week at a time (and subsequently lose over 20kg in one year ... no I was not 
          a small boy :p ).<br>I soon found out it had been stress and because of this I 
          learnt so much about how closely our minds well being is linked with our bodies strength and vitality. 
          Since that realization I have spent a very decent amount of 
          time looking inside myself, at how I react internally with regards to the external on-goings.<br> 
          So to take the Siberian North Railroad is not just beneficial to what you are currently doing, it also 
          helps with the things you are not looking at or dealing with.<br>
        </p>
        <p>  
          Live life with a smile,<br>
          And in doing so,<br>
          Stick around for a while.<br>
