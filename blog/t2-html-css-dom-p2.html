          Q.<br>What is grid based design?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.<br>The grid based design has been formulated to be a simple to implement, unseen structure, that helps a web developer quickly arrange their page and the placement of their content. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.<br>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.<br>A responsive webpage, is one that is aware of the screen resolution and ratio, that it is going to be displayed on, and is coded such that it alters how and what it shows, to best highlight the content of the page accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.<br>What is semantic structure?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.<br>Semantically structuring your HTML and CSS makes it such that strangers to the code can understand what content will go where, when it get's opened in a browser.<br> 
          i.e. You wrap the different segments of your content with descriptive tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.<br>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.
        </p>
        <p>
          A.<br>I like the concept of Bootstrap. The idea to have a set source of pre-determined id's, classes and parameters for an individual to quickly lay down the initial frame and structure of a page professionally.
          But I can see how it would really come into its element when used, in a project with multiple collaborating developers.
