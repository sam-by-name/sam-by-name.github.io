            Have you tried using empathic listening, loving kindness meditation, the insight and techniques 
            for growing trust and sincerity? How did they go? 
          </strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes, all of them and then some.
          It's hard to condense nearly thirty years of trying, succeeding 
          and failing, to connect too and to understand other living beings. 
          But I shall give it a shot. 
          I am an open book and very .. spiritual? in my perspective of the universe and
          all beings within it. Whether 'chaos', 'chance', 'alien/divine 
          entities play project' or just that we are all 'one' consciousness existing in 
          the vastness of nothing. Viewing and experiencing ourselves from as many different 
          perspectives as possible, in pursuit of self understanding and betterment or 
          maybe just to while away the time.<br>I know at least these few things. 
          We all benefit from caring for each other,
          We all suffer when one of us is indecent to another and dare I say, 
          the inflicter is more damaged by the event than the victim (in most case's anyway).
          As our species progressed, we learnt that we were stronger as one, 
          and that we could get ahead in the game by pooling our resources and efforts.
          But I believe we have now come to the point where we need to be less interdependent,
          and become stronger and more capable as individuals, so as to strengthen 
          and further enable the whole. To reach that next level I believe we must 
          use our strength of interdependence to new heights and to do our best to 
          help enable those less able to be self dependant, to become stronger.
          The idiom "A chain is no stronger than it's weakest link" comes to mind, 
          if you wish for a pragmatic shortening.
          As for growing trust and sincerity .. well for others towards me, it 
          will take them the time to trust me, that it takes for them to open up to me. 
          But for me, I trust all beings until they have given me good reason to 
          doubt their sincerity and integrity. Even then, I just keep make sure 
          to keep them at a safe distance, they still have my sincerity.
          As for "How did it go" ... well it's still going and I am still positive :D

          <strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong>
        </h5>      
        <p>
          Bullying, rape, racism, anti-semitism, culling, genocide, dumbing down, mind 
          control and self abuse and much much more have gone on since the dawn of our time.
          Our history books only cover an nth of our actual time thus far and all of 
          the above are the most prevalent throughout them. 
          We are exquisite star dust children ... but we are still so very
          infantile. Torn within ourselves and as such segregated outside of ourselves.
          We are now at a point in time, in our evolution as individuals, as a species and
          as the currently responsible overseers of this planet and all life on it, 
          where it is time to cease this self inflicted denial and finally uphold the 
          mantle we have so far, proclaimed to carry. 
          But before this can be done, we need to first mend the bridges inside our hearts, 
          that connect us to all other living beings on this planet.<br><br>
          It is somewhat hard to write the counter to this argument, as ironically (sadly),
          the vast majority of us mostly hold true to the above mentioned perspective.
          But in the name of science I shall give you one many of us have likely heard.<br><br>
          Sure killing is bad, and war is terrible ... but look at all the great inventions 
          that have come about during and because of them. Look at the technological leaps and
          bounds we have made over such short periods of time ... the medical advances. 
          Then also consider our situation regarding overpopulation. How many more 
          people would there be if we didn't keep killing ourselves.
