        <p>If i were to attempt an analagy of HTML, CSS and DOM I guess ...</p>
        HTML is your body.<br>
        CSS is how you dress and present your social self. <br>
        DOM is your mind, It can be used influence your body and it can even be a gateway to other influences, both cool and crazy.<br>

        <p>Boxifying design que?</p>
        <p>Let's keep going with the analogies shall we?<br>
        The Universe is a box, inside that box, Galaxies reside within their own boxes and subsiquently solar systems too are in their own,<br>
        see where I'm going with this? Basically ... you and me ... yep, you guessed it, both in our own boxes.<br>
        Getting kinda sad right now ...<br>
        But fear not!!!
        The box model is here to lighten the mood.</p>

        <p>But what is the box model?</p>
        
        <p>Ahh, the box model, we love you box model ... well mostly anyway.<br>
        Since everyone and everything is in a box.<br>
        The box model is our way of seeing and manipulating our boxes, it comprises of a few key elements.
        The "margin" goes on the outside of our boxes, to protect our box from other boxes (or maybe ever stop others from seeing ours).<br>
        Then there is the "border", our own self determind peramiters, the middle ground between margins and padding.<br>
        Finaly, the padding, our padding is there to give us room to move around within our boxes.<br>
        The Universe is a box full of boxes, inside all those many many boxes are the content that makesit as magical as it truely is.<br>
        I for one have my padding and margin set to 0, my border though cannot be removed without the lose of me, has at least been set to an opacity of 0.<br>
