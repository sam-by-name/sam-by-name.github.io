          <strong>If I were to attempt an analogy of HTML, CSS and DOM, I guess ...</strong>
        </p>
        <p>HTML is your body.<br>
          CSS is how you dress and present your social self. <br>
          DOM is your mind, It can be used to influence your body and it can even be a gateway to other influences, 
          both cool and crazy.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Boxifying design que?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's keep going with the analogies shall we?<br>
          The Universe is a box, inside that box, Galaxies reside within their own boxes and subsequently 
          solar systems too are in their own,<br>
          see where I'm going with this? Basically ... you and me ... yep, you guessed it, both in our own boxes.<br>
          Getting kinda sad right now ...<br>
          But fear not!!!
          The box model is here to lighten the mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>But what is the box model?</strong>
        </p> 
        <p>Ah, the box model, we love you box model ... well mostly anyway.<br>
          Since everyone and everything is in a box.<br>
          The box model is our way of seeing and manipulating our boxes, it comprises of a few key elements.
          The "margin" goes on the outside of our boxes, to protect our box from all the other boxes 
          (or maybe ever stop others from seeing ours).<br>
          Then there is the "border", our own self determined parameters, the middle ground between margins 
          and padding.<br>
          Finally, the padding, our padding is there determine where we stand within our boxes.<br>
          The Universe is a box full of boxes, inside all those many, many boxes are the content that makes 
          it as magical as it truly is.<br>
          I for one, have my padding and margin set to 0, my border, though it cannot be removed without 
          the loss of me, has at least been set to an opacity of 0.
