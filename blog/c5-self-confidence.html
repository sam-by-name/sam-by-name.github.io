        <h2>Insight == Sight</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Mindfullness</em><br>
          External : To show awareness of others sensibilities, of the current situation, for the short and long term.<br>
          Internal : To be conscious of how the external on-going's are affecting us.<br><br>
          <em>Self Awareness</em><br>
          External : To show humility in the face of our successes and failings.<br>
          Internal : To be mindful of yourself, your mental state, physical state, your strengths and weakness's.<br><br>

          <em>Self Mindfull Awareness</em><br>
          Hand in hand,<br>
          Them both combined,<br> 
          Our Universe is but one,<br>
          Forever entwined.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this chapter, we learnt about two new techniques for self connection, understanding 
          and reflection that are designed to help us see under our own facades.<br>
          One is <em>Body Scan</em> where to sit and close your eyes, take your focus from body part to body part. Seeking 
          sensation or not, just focus on it and reconnect with your body. I tried this one as I was already 
          siting on the floor and its something I do as I meditate anyway. It's good to pay heed to your components ... sometimes 
          we learn to ignore them if we deem ourselves to have more pressing matters.<br><br>
          The other is <em>Journaling</em> and is one most will already have heard of. The core concept here is essentially 
          the same. Except rather than writing a chronicle of your day, you instead write about anything and nothing for a 
          few minutes each day, in pursuit of getting your raw inner voice onto paper. I will be putting this into shortly.
        </p>

          "My Emotions are Not Me" But ...
        </p>
        <p>
          Our emotions are like an untamed horse, left to their own devices, they can dictate where and how we go if we let them. 
          Continuing the analogy where our mind and body are the riders and the horse our emotions, 
          if we do not learn to calm, train or understand our emotions, they may throw us to the ground.
          The horse is a majestic living being and must be respected and seen as such.
