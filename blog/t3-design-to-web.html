          <strong>What is a mobile first design, or a responsive website and why are they so
           important?.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As mobile internet started to kick off, website developers and businesses  
          alike were faced with the problem of their websites being poorly displayed on  
          these smaller devices. The results were, slow loading pages, large data  
          requirements, sluggish response times and a whole lot of pinch zooming. Which of  
          course lead to, not overly happy visitors, potentially lost customers and  
          concerned businesses. The answer of the time was to make separate mobile only  
          versions of these sites. But these mobile only sites cost a good chunk of  
          unnecessary developing time and money.<br><br> 
          So along came the real answer, a mobile first design and approach. Where the  
          design team and developers focus there thoughts first, on how a webpage will  
          best display and be interacted with on smaller devices and then work their way  
          up in display size. In situ with this change of creative start point and the ever diversifying range of  
          display sizes and resolutions, came the concept of a responsive website. A one site to rule them all concept was born. 
          The idea is, when you access a webpage from whatever device you are on, the code of the site, first asks for the  
          width of the device it is to be displayed on. Our devices response determines the information/layout sent, so that the best 
          results are displayed every time. This solution is a win for all involved, less cost, less maintenance, a more uniform  
          experience across the ever growing selection of devices, less data waste, faster load times and responsiveness ... 
          Important? I'd say so.

          <strong>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>  
          A framework is basically a set of predetermined rules and parameters that have been assigned to keywords and commands. 
          There are quite a few different frameworks out there and some are better suited to specific tasks and projects. 
          The idea behind having and using one of these frameworks is, there is less work to get a project started and the  
          initial structure (framework :P ) in place. It is far easier to work on a project with multiple minds and hands working towards  
          the same goal if the conditions and rules are unified and knowable by all before it even starts. New developers can join  
          in fairly seamlessly.<br>There are of course negatives and limitations depending on what framework you choose and for what  
          job, but some of these would include:<br>Why do all these websites look like they were made by the same team.<br>How do we separate  
          ourselves from the rest.<br>What unseen rules are causing these undesired effects on my code<br>And sometimes,<br> 
          Wouldn't it just be easier to start from the ground up?<br>I guess the simple solution is similar to how we do well 
          in our other life quests, pick the right tools for for desired end project ... before you start it.

          <strong>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put, a wireframe is a first draft blueprint for our website.  
          A bare bones sketch for how we would like it to be laid out and 
          a visual and unified representation for us to follow as we build.
