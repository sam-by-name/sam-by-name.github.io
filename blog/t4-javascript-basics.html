          <strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If HTML is your skeleton and CSS your external cosmetic complexion, then JavaScript is 
          your behavior. HTML and CSS are constants but through JavaScript we can augment and 
          alter them to seem moving and alive. Or even disappear them completely. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 
          'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our days are on loop until a certain parameter ends the loop.<br>
          In our days we go through some form of ordered process,
          We execute certain functions.<br>
          Sometimes ours flow are affected by "ifs","buts" or sub "loops"
          If its sunny, go for a walk.<br>
          But its been a long week and im tired, who needs exercise anyway?<br>
          Weekly loop "is there enough food for my next meal", half onion, no carrots, celery gone bad 
          and no potatoes = if "can be arsed" go to the shop, else "get a take-away and deal with it later".<br>
          Our control flow, lays out the order of how we execute our functions, sometimes dynamic, 
          sometimes its just an matter of process.
        </p>
        <p>         
          <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          An array has a number based indexing system, so you call upon its contents by using the array name 
          followed by its numerical index [42]. An objects properties on the other hand are defined and 
          called upon by their property names.<br>A simple way to think about how they differ is, one is a nice
          orderly row of items (array) and can be accessed by number. The other is an unsightly pile of items
          (object) and to know whats in the pile and how to access them, you shall name them and call for them
          by name.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A function is much what you might expect them to be. A process (or process of processes) that you 
          define to execute upon command and reusable on many things once defined.
