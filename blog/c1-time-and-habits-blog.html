      <h2>Time and Habbits</h2> 
      <p>I deploy a whole host of different techniques when centering, motivating and pushing myself.<br>
      But most importantly what I have learnt over the years, is that no one technique rules them all,<br>variety is the spice of life and just as all beings are unique, so too are the moments of now and those to come.<br>
      I love meditation I find it great for a whole host of different reasons and I use it regularly in its varying forms,<br>but one particular aspect I find beneficial in many situations, is the practice of deep breathing.<br>
      There is a reason that those who lead a different life than that of the scientific or spiritual one still use the phrase "take a deep breath".<br>It's not just for its scientific or spiritual benefits, but also to enable us to step back and reassess a situation.<br>
      I am a firm believer that patience and respect of oneself are key, to a balanced center and a great initial launchpad into any given task.<br>
      When timeboxing I have used and experimented with many methods. <br> My current preferred first steps are to lay out the goal/s and allot the time to reach it.<br>Then I reprogram myself to believe the available time is less because .. Who doesn't love a good buffer :).<br> 
      From my first waking thought of what I need (want) to achieve for the day,<br>flowing into how long I will allow for each of the more imminent tasks, so as to reach the daily target.<br>
      Today's goal is to finish Sprint 1, I believe it very much within reach, <br>though I do acknowledge that the most likely part to over consume my allotted time is the prettifying of my pages.<br>
      Through my jobs and experiences I have come to firmly know that 90% of any well done job, is the preparation.<br>
      But this leave's a seemingly lowly 10% for the cosmetic component ... But being me,<br>the trick is to keep the imperative 90% within 80% of the timeframe without cutting corners, so I get enough time to be proud of the finish!<br>
      They say "pride comes before a fall", and while it certainly can,<br>it is also a great way to incentivize oneself and reward in kind upon completion.<br>

      As Fogg talks about, the mini success's we allow ourselves,<br> pave the way not only to well learnt habits but also to a more enjoyed journey towards our goals.<br>
      Though I have used and implemented a variety of timeboxing methods, <br>I had not come across the Pomodoro until now. It intrigues me and I look forward to utilizing and experimenting with it in the tasks ahead.<br>
      One of the hardest habits and techniques in life to remember and command in the heat of the moment,<br> is that our biggest resource of life teachings is in our failings.<br>
      The step back, deep breath, wide scan and mental imprint, in the frozen by us moment of calamity, is one to hold close and grow from.</p>
