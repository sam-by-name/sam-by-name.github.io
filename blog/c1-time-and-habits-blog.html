        <h2>Time Habits</h2><br>
        <p>
          I deploy a whole host of different techniques when centering, motivating and pushing myself.
          But most importantly what I have learnt over the years, is that no one technique rules them all,
          variety is the spice of life and just as all beings are unique, 
          so too are the moments of now and those to come.<br>
        I love meditating I find it great for a whole host of different reasons and I use it regularly in its varying forms,
          but one particular aspect I find beneficial in many situations, is the practice of deep breathing.<br>
          There is a reason that those who lead a different life than that of the scientific or spiritual one still use the phrase "take a deep breath".
          It's not just for its scientific or spiritual benefits, but also to enable us to step back and reassess a situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a firm believer that patience and respect of oneself are key to a balanced center and are a great initial launchpad into any given task.
          When timeboxing I have used and experimented with many methods. My current preferred first steps are to lay out the goal/s and allot the time to reach it.
          Then I reprogram myself to believe the available time is less because .. Who doesn't love a good buffer :).
        </p> 
        <p>As Fogg talks about, the mini success's we allow ourselves, 
          pave the way not only to well learnt habits but also to a more enjoyed journey towards our goals.<br>
          Though I have used and implemented a variety of timeboxing methods, 
          I had not come across the Pomodoro until now. It intrigues me and I look forward to utilizing and experimenting with it in the tasks ahead.<br>
          One of the hardest habit and technique in life to remember and command in the heat of the moment, 
          is that our biggest resource of life teachings is in our failings.
          The step back, deep breath, wide scan and mental imprint, in the frozen by us moment of calamity, is one to hold close and grow from.
