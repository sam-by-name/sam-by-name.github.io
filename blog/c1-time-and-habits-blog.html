    <p>I deploy a whole host of different techniques when centering, motivating and pushing myself.<br>
    But most importantly what I have learnt over the years, is that no one technique rules them all, veriety is the spice of life and just as all beings are unique, so too are the moments of now and those to come.<br>
    I love meditation I find it great for a whole host of different reasons and I use it regulaly in its varying forms, but one perticular aspect I find benificial in many situations, is the practice of deep breathing.<br>
    There is a reason that those who lead a different life than that of the scientific or spiritual one still use the phrase "take a deep breath". It's not just for its scientific or spiritual benifits, but also to enable us to step back and reaccess a situation.<br>
    I am a firm believer that patience and respect of oneself are key, to a balanced center and a great initial launchpad into any given task.<br>
    In the timeboxing depertment I have used and experimented with many methods, when laying out the goal and alloting the time to reach it. I then reprogram myself to believe the available time is less because .. who doesn't love a good buffer :).<br> 
    From my first waking thought of what I need (want) to acheive for the day, flowing into how long I will allow for each of the more iminent tasks, so as to reach the daily target.<br>
    Todays goal is to finish Sprint 1, I beleive it very much within reach, though I do awknoledge that the most likely part to over consure my alotted time is the prettifying of my pages.<br>
    Through my jobs and experiences I have come to firmlly know that 90% of any well done job, is the preperation.<br>
    But this leave's a seemingly lowly 10% for the cosmetic component ... but being me, the trick is to keep the imperative 90% within 80% of the timeframe without cutting corners, so I get enough time to be proud of the finish!<br>
    They say "pride comes before a fall", and while it certainly can, it is also a great way to incentivise oneself and reward in kind upon completion.<br>

    As Fogg talks about, the mini success's we allow ourselves, pave the way not only to well learnt habbits but also to a more enjoyed journey towards our goals.<br>
    Though I have used and implimented a veriety of timeboxing methods, I had not come across the Pomodoro until now. It intrigues me and I look forward to utilizing and experimenting with it in the tasks ahead.<br>
    One of the hardest habits and techniques in life to remember and command in the heat of the moment, is that our biggest resource of life teachings is in our failings.<br>
    The step back, deep breath, wide scan and mental imprint, in the frozen by us moment of calamity, is one to hold close and grow from.</p>
