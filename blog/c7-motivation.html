        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <h5>            
          <strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Many believe in and seek the "3 P's" in the order they are displayed below.
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pleasure - short-term highs, living in the fast lane, live fast die young.</li>
            <li>Passion  - living in the ebb and flow of the universe, while not light speed, time has ceaced to exist here.</li>
            <li>Purpose  - unique to the individual and a source to boundless cosmic energy</li> 
          </ul>
        <p>
          While this way of life may be completely viable for some, it is fraught with inconsistency and can oft lead to
          an internal unbalance and subsequently yield less happiness than from first glance.<br>The happiness felt and 
          gained from living a life of passion is far more sustainable ... but finding ones passion and flow is not always
          so easy. Purpose, but more specifically "Higher Purpose" if you can find it, is a place from which eternal happiness
          and endless drive can come from. As spoken about in this chapter, I have always found it easier to find/use my 
          'Higher Purpose' to fall into and feel my flow and then when I occasionally venture out of my norm to taste those 
          momentary, intense emotions that are pleasure. I savour them all the more and their resonating effect lasts 
          longer and puts spring in my step as I return to my flow.
        </p><br>
        <h5>
          <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>  
          <em>Here is the unedited version of what I wrote at the time.</em>
        </p>
        <h5>What are your core values? </h5>
        <p>
          Peace and Love<br>
          Kindness  and Care<br>
          Decency and shared prosperity<br>
          Endurance in the face of impossibility<br>
          Always finding common ground<br>
        </p>
        <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
        <p>
          Those who can't<br>
          Those who try to but could use the camaraderie<br>
          For those who lash out and are hated for it, but are really just a consequence of other suffering<br>
          Happiness<br>
          Equal opportunities<br>
          A situation where everybody wins even if it seems that I lose in the process<br>
          Others smiles are sustenance enough!<br><br>
          <em>Putting the above here leaves me feeling a little naked ... but you would find out soon enough anyway, 
          so I guess there is little harm :)
          One thing I neglected (to my dismay) to put under core values is "Honesty", I have alway found myself 
          to be genuine ... to a fault! (or genuinely faulty :D depending who's judging)</em>
