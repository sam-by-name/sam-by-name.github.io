          Q. What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
        </p>
        <p>
          A. What I see when I look at the DBC/EDA experience, is their way of teaching and growing 
          the individual, as part of a whole and living, community.<br>
          A family outside of it's normal definition, one bound not by blood, but instead by commonly held values and goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.What are your impressions?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.My impressions so far are that my first impressions were right on the money.<br>Here resides 
          a school, a home, a place of work and growth, 
          that I would love nothing more than to be a part of.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.I can hardly wait to further immerse myself in what I have seen of the EDA culture.<br>
          To give it my all, only to be humbled and then ride the emotions that come from short team defeats.<br>
          To reflect, look deeper inside and see the still more, yet untouched gears that we all have and to 
          learn as a group how to put them into action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.Trepidation voided, gut instincts confimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q.Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
        </p>
        <p>
          A.I am really looking forward to more EDA experience, excited to be a part of the Mamaku cohort 
          and my nerves are as of now, resting. I have no doubt that as a whole, we can overcome inconceivable odds.
